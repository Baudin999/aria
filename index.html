<h1 id="aria-2">Aria 2</h1>

<p>Aria is a Pen and Paper RPG system designed from the ground up to decrease complexity and deliver a really broad range of options. At the core of Aria lies a system with two philosophies, the first is that everything you do costs effort. The effort of something you do, an action, is distilled into action points. The second philosophy is that time is linear, so actions have a duration or have a recovery time and these are not managed by rounds or turns but by a linear line along which combat progresses.</p>

<p>These two ideas form the basic building block of everything in the game system. For example, an action, say the casting of a fireball costs 3 action points and the cast time is twenty initiative. </p>



<h1 id="xp-and-levels">XP and Levels</h1>

<p>Experience is quantifiable in Aria by a point system called Experience Points (XP). XP can be used to increase your proficiency at something, usually a skill. Or at level five you can learn dual specialisation for ten XP. You earn experience points by surviving missions or training. </p>

<p>Experience accumulates into moments of understanding which are called levels. I like to think of levels as having had an “Ah ha!” moment. The following structure shows how you increase your level:</p>

<table>
<thead>

</tbody></table>


<p>As you can see from this table every level takes 1 extra XP to reach, making it harder and harder to level up. Your Racial and Professional XP does not count towards a level. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Side Note: When you compare XP in Aria to XP in Avalon you can compare about 10xp in Avalon with 1xp in Aria. To give you an idea, for level 10 we’ll need 155xp in Aria and about 1500xp in Avalon.</p>
</blockquote>



<h1 id="statististics">Statististics</h1>

<p>There are four statistics is Aria. A statistic is a core potential of a character. We can list the following statistics:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Name</th>
  <th>Code</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
  <td>Physique</td>
  <td>PHY</td>
  <td>The physical power of a character. Physique is the basis of all the weapon skills. Physique is also the static DMG reduction of a character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Intuition</td>
  <td>INU</td>
  <td>Intuition is the mental power of a character. Intuition is the basis of all the magical skills and the learned skill. Intuition is also the character’s ability to become aware of something through thought.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Agility</td>
  <td>AGI</td>
  <td>Agility or nimbleness is the ability to change the body’s position.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Perception</td>
  <td>PER</td>
  <td>The ability to become aware of something through the senses.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>Every character starts with every statistic at 1. Your racial package and professional package result in a few extra points which are pre determined. When you start a character you get 2 statistic points you can assign randomly.</p>

<p>Every level grants you 2 statistic points you can assign randomly.</p>



<h2 id="hit-points-hp">Hit Points (HP)</h2>

<p>Every character has Hit Points (HP). HP is a quantifiable amount of life. Because Aria is a magical setting your HP can be seen as your life force granted by the universe.</p>

<p>You HP is the total of all of your statistics. Some professions let your PHY counts double, these professions are: Warrior, Druid and Necromancer. So, when you start, before you’ve undergone training resulting in racial and professional packages you’ll have a minimum of 6 HP, if you choose to put both of your free statistic points on PHY and choose to be a Warrior you will have 9 HP without counting the statistic points from your racial and professional packages. </p>

<p>Your race, class, gear, abilities and spells can grant permanent or temporary bonuses to your Statistics and as a result to your HP.</p>



<h2 id="action-points-ap">Action Points (AP)</h2>

<p>With Action Points (AP) you can do actions. An action is something your character does and takes time, like casting a spell or striking at an enemy with your sword. </p>

<p>A standard attack or spell takes three (3) AP, every defensive action also takes three (3) AP. In time you will regenerate these action points. You cannot get below zero (0) action points. Because Aria is a fluent game system, meaning that it does not have rounds and turns, your AP will decrease and increase during the course of a combat. Deciding when to attack and when not to is really important. If your character reaches zero (0) AP you can’t move faster than a slow walk and you cannot fight because you are incredibly fatigued. </p>

<p>A second thing you can do with AP is modify your DMG taken after a failed defensive action or increase your DMG done. One AP can increase or decrease your DMG by one (1). </p>

<p>The last thing you can do with AP are Power Stunts (PS) and Feats of Strength (FoS). Every character will get standard FoS like Climbing a steep wall or sprinting; depending on the duration of the Feat the GM will decide how many AP are needed. A rule of thumb is that sprinting one hundred (100) meters costs eight (8) AP. During the time of the FoS or PS you will not regenerate AP. </p>

<p>Power Stunts are special abilities which take AP to trigger or maintain. For example Sixth Sense will alert you when you are the target of an unforeseen damaging action. Every time this ability triggers it will cost you three (3) AP. This is an example of a passive power. There are also active powers, for example, Warriors can choose the Power: Whirlwind which will automatically perform the attack you did on another target as well. Each target you choose to attack will cost you three (3) AP.</p>



<h2 id="initiative">Initiative</h2>

<p>As hinted on before, Aria is a fluent game system. Aria still has the factor “time” which is expressed in terms of Initiative Points (IP). A combat starts at Initiative zero 0. Each character rolls a D20 and this is the starting point of the character on the timeline. Each action you perform takes some time, for example, hitting someone with a dagger costs 8 IP to recuperate from that action. Hitting someone with a big two handed axe takes 21 IP. This means that the guy with the daggers can hit the guy with the axe twice before the axe guy is. </p>

<p>A combat starts with everyone throwing a d20 to determine where in the timeline they start. Melee weapons may attack at that point and after their attack they will suffer a <em>cool down period</em> depending on the speed of the weapon. Casters have a cast time, this is the time it takes for the spell to actually fire. Basically there are three types of IP costing things you can do. There are things from which you need to recuperation, like attacking with a dagger. There are things which need IP to prepare, like casting a Fireball and lastly there are continuous things like running. </p>

<p>Continuous actions will cost a fixed amount of AP. For example: running from place <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-1">A \rightarrow B</script> will cost you, twenty AP. While you are running you do not recuperate AP every thirty IP and at the end you will have to pay 20 AP. Everything harder than walking will “block AP regeneration” except for combat so running, climbing, working in a smithy etc will all cost a set amount of AP. The activities section of the manual will list activities and their respective AP costs.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb you can think of 100m costing 1AP while walking. Jogging is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-2">AP * 2</script>, Running <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-3">AP * 4</script>, Sprinting <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-4">AP * 8</script>.</p>



<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>A skill is the ability to do something. Every skill needs to be bought for 1xp from either your racial package, professional package or XP and is tied to a statistic. Every skill has the minimum level of that statistic once bought. A skill increases with 1 per XP. Your eventual prowess is called your skill level. </p>

<p>When you want to perform a task with the skill, for example attack someone with your weapon skill you roll a d20 and add the roll to your skill level. For example, my weapon skill is 13 and I roll a 4 my attack will be with level 17. </p>

<p>Gear, abilities and buffs can modify your skill level. The skill section of the manual will list all the skills and have their description.</p>



<h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>

<p>Magic is the ability to change reality with your mental power and some arcane knowledge. Magic in Aria is very straight forward, when you choose a magical profession you get a magic skill and a lore skill. Every 5 XP you put into the magic or lore skill will grant you one spell point which you can spend on spells with every rank has to be 10 lore level higher. You can either upgrade a spell or buy a new one if your lore is equal or higher than the lore needed to buy the spell.</p>

<p>For example:</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5">
Fireball: 20 INI,  \; 2d6 + 2 \; DMG
</script></p>

<p>You can cast this Fireball which takes 20 IP to cast and costs 3 AP, every action costs 3 AP. Your magic skill is 12. You roll 1d20 + 12 against the dodge of the target. </p>

<p>Magic gives a bit more flexibility within a combat. You can decide to <em>double your cast</em> effectively taking twice as long and costing twice the amount of AP, giving your spell a dmg modifier of <em>times 2</em>. So in the previous fireball example you can say:</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6">
Fireball: 6 AP, \; 40 IP,  \; (2d6 + 2) * 2 \; DMG
</script></p>

<p>Tripling your cast time does <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7">(2d6 + 2) * 2.5 \; DMG</script>, Quadrupling: <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8">(2d6 + 2) * 2.75 \; DMG</script>, Quintupling: <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-9">(2d6 + 2) * 3 \; DMG</script> and that is as far as you are allowed to go. While casting you do not recuperate.</p>

<p>Every spell can be grouped in one of three types: Offensive, Defensive and Utility. Every Defensive spell, unless stated otherwise, lasts 60 IP. Each extra rank to the spell can increase the duration with +10 IP or the number of targets +1.</p>



<h3 id="offensive-spells">Offensive Spells</h3>

<p>Offensive spells either do DMG or hinder a target. For example, the spell Slow increases recuperation or preparation times. The spell Fireball does DMG to a target’s HP. Not every spell can be resisted with a skill. Fireball can be resisted with Dodge but Slow can only be resisted by counter spelling or casting Haste. </p>

<p>Every default Offensive spell which does DMG is modeled after a weapon so when creating spells you can choose the DMG from the weapon’s table. The Cooldown of the spell will be like the Initiative of the weapon. For example: Magic missiles are set to the DMG of daggers while Fireball is set to that of a two handed axe. Maintaining this balance between melee and magic is important.</p>

<p>Every offensive spell which a drain or a leach will by default do: 1 + 1 per rank of the effect per recuperation so every 30 IP. For example, Drain Life, the priest spell, does -1 HP per 30 IN. Each rank you put into this spell will increase that with 1. So at lore level 32 I can buy rank 4 or the spell and so -5 HP per 30 IN.</p>

<p>With spells you cannot modify the DMG of the spell with action points the way you can with a melee attack. </p>

<p>Offensive spells have a base range of 15 meters (unless stated otherwise). Each rank increases this range with 5 meters. Each offensive spell can get an extra target per every other rank. So rank 1, one target, rank 3 two targets, rank 5 three targets. For example a rank 5 fireball can shoot at three targets. If you shoot these three fireballs at one person and he does not dodge he gets 3 times the impact and you roll three times for DMG. </p>

<p>Unless stated otherwise each rank of an offensive spell can increase the DMG with 1 of the die plus 1 but will automatically increase the IM with 10 or a rank can lower the IM with 10 with a minimum of 15. So the fireball in the example can get +1d6 + 1 but will have the Cooldown increased with 10; or the Cooldown can be reduced with 10. </p>



<h3 id="use-the-source">Use the Source!</h3>

<p>When mages learn their craft they create an item, called a <em>Source</em>. When a magic user equips a <em>Source</em> he or she can cast bolts called Magic Missiles which do the DMG of a Dagger 3d4 + (1d4 per lvl). A source counts as an offhand weapon.</p>



<h3 id="defensive-spells-protection">Defensive Spells &amp; Protection</h3>

<p>Defensive spells counter certain elements of the game. For example a shield increases armor. Wards are static spells which protect an area against certain other spells. For example, a caster can erect a ward against Fire reducing Fire DMG taking within the area.</p>

<p>Unless stated otherwise a defensive spell works like: <br>
Every rank grants a +1 to the effect of the spell. The duration of the spell is increased by 5 Initiative and you can cast the spell on 1 other target for +1AP. So at rank 1 you can cast Stone Skin on 2 targets for (3 + 1)AP.</p>

<p>Every caster gets the following armor spell:</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-10">
Armor: 3AP, \; 10 IP, Grants \; your \; PHY \; as \; armor  \; from \; PHY \; attacks.
</script></p>

<p>Every caster automatically gets <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-11">INU</script> as a resistance to magic. You can see this as pure magical resistance. For instance, a fireball does <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-12">20 \; DMG</script>, your <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-13">INU</script> is <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-14">7</script>, you lose <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-15">13 \; HP</script>. </p>



<h3 id="utility">Utility</h3>

<p>A utility spell helps out with a mundane task. There are a couple of types, Movement, Search and Find and Frivolous. An example of a movement spell is <em>Fly</em>. An example of a Search and Find spell is <em>Detect Presence</em> which can detect people. An example of a Frivolous spell is <em>Alter appearance</em>.</p>



<h3 id="counter-spelling">Counter Spelling</h3>

<p>You can only counter a spell once it has been released. Dispelling is easier than casting a spell, but because it is completely reactive it costs more AP to counter-spell.</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-16">
Counter Spell: 5 AP, \; 10 IP
</script></p>

<p>Every rank of the spell one side of the casting/counter spelling side has on the other side gives a -3 to the magic skill of the lower side. So imagine a fire mage casting a fireball rank 1, the counter spell is done by a healing priest without the fireball spell; this healing priest now gets a -3 to his magic skill. They both roll a d20 and the one with the higher skill level wins.</p>

<p>Imagine this same mage casting a fireball rank 1 against his fire teacher who has rank 5 of the same spell, a difference of 4. This teacher now gets a +12 to his magic skill to counter the spell. </p>

<p>For each 10 points of margin the counter speller wins with he gets 1 AP returned with a minimum of 1 AP for the counter-spell. </p>



<h2 id="powers">Powers</h2>

<p>A power is something which makes your character different, it is an innate ability or something you can actively turn off and on again. At the beginning of your career you can choose one Power from either the spells section, the blessings section or the Special Abilities section, you can also use a Power to become an adept at a profession lowering the level needed for either the path or the discipline with one.</p>

<p>A power is meant to augment your character and deliver a alternate play style. For example, a barbarian can choose <em>Stone Skin</em> from the Earth Spells or a mage can choose <em>Communicate with Animals</em>. These powers are designed to give you an advantage at the beginning of the game but they become less important as the game progresses. </p>



<h3 id="spells">Spells</h3>

<p>You can choose every spell up to rank one and with a difficulty of less than 30 (so up to and including 29). Activating the spell costs 3 AP and follows the standard description of the spell. </p>



<h3 id="blessings">Blessings</h3>

<p>Gods can grant a blessing, you can choose a priestly spell up to rank one with a difficulty of less than 30  (so up to and including 29). A blessing is mostly passive and will have a reduced effect which is always on. People who have a blessing should embody the God or lose the blessing. </p>

<p>Blessings show in Detect Magic spells as an active spell, blessings can be dispelled just like normal spells but they return after 50 IP.</p>



<h2 id="special-abilities">Special Abilities</h2>

<p>Each profession gets 12 skill points with which you can buy new skills or increase skills. Casters and Druids, except Skinwalkers, must buy Magic and Lore. Rogues must buy Hide and Sneak. Warriors and Skinwalkers must buy a Weapon skill and Dodge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hide in plain sight</strong>: Allow hide rolls in situations where you otherwise couldn’t even roll. This is not a magical ability and this is not something which prevents the penalties from difficult situations. For example, when you are walking through a city you are not allowed to roll for hide. Someone with this perk is allowed to roll a hide check.</p>

<h3 id="dual-class">Dual Class</h3>

<p>Every character can dual class, they can buy their second class with 10 XP from their Professional Package and with this they can buy a second profession. The other way to dual class is to pay 10 XP once you hit lvl 5. </p>

<h3 id="mages">Mages</h3>

<p>Mages can wield terrible powers. They can destroy enemies at range or protect themselves with arcane powers. Mages can summon terrible creatures or bring long dead warriors back to life as their minions. </p>



<h4 id="description">Description</h4>

<p>Mages can walk three paths, the path of the elements, the path of the demons and the path of illusions. All of these paths come with their own set of very powerful spells and abilities.  </p>

<p><img src="http://yuml.me/af937884" alt="" title=""></p>

<!-- http://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy;dir:TB/class/edit/%2F%2F Cool Class Diagram, [Mage], [Mage]-[Elementalist], [Mage]-[Demonologist], [Mage]-[Illusionist] -->



<h3 id="spells-1">Spells</h3>

<p>There are four disciplines you can practice as an elemental mage: Earth, Fire, Water and Air. Combinations of these paths result in: Lava, Frost and Lightning. These combinations can only be taken when dual classing your character.</p>

<p>Earth is stabilizing. Fire is destructive and unpredictive, Water restores and gives life and Air is illusive and evasive. These qualities enhance and give meaning to the practitioner. Because of the way the discipline works mages with an affinity to these disciplines tend to have their character traits converge with the traits of their element.  </p>

<p>Each rank above the described rank does either more DMG and higher IM or lowers the IM. Each rank also is 5 points lore harder to learn.</p>

<p>Every mage can start with 2 spells and can roll for a third spell. Lore + 1d20 should be greater than the Difficulty of the spell.</p>

<h4 id="paladin">Paladin</h4>

<p>Paladins are holy warriors. They are specialized in the eradication of evil like demons and undead. There are three paths a paladin can follow and every level they gain they should choose one spell from that level. </p>

<p>Paladins start with three spells:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regenerate: 1 life per recuperation.  (+1 per level), this ability is always active.</li>
<li>Protect: +2 armor (+1 per level), instant cast, lasts the duration of the combat. </li>
<li>Destroy evil: +2 DMG against undead and demons.  This spell is always on. If you even “shake the hand of an undead” you will deal 2 DMG and will know it’s a demon.</li>

  <td>Directed strike lowers the target’s PV with <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-452">(25 + lvl</script>)% on a successful hit. Costs 3AP.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>A rogue can only do his specials, except for Vanish, when he holds smaller, maneuverable weapons. An effective rogue therefor always uses daggers.</p>

<p>At level 5 a Rogue can choose a specialisation; this is either Subtlety or Combat. </p>

<h4 id="subtlety">Subtlety</h4>

<p>Cooldown of vanish is not 50 - (lvl * 2) and the duration of vanish is * 10. So a lvl 5 Subtlety Rogue can vanish for 50 initiative points into the Shadow Realm. During this time you may move unhindered, you can pass through smaller spaces than when in the normal world.</p>

<h4 id="combat">Combat</h4>

<p>Combat Rogues prefer a fight over sneaking around. Directed Strike costs no AP and can be used on every attack as long as the Rogue uses daggers or fist weapons. Directed Strike now reduces <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-472">(25 + lvl*2)\%</script> armor. So at level 5 you will reduce <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-473">35\%</script> armor from the target.</p>

<p>Because the paths of a Druid can be radically different we will treat all the paths as different paths.</p>



<h2 id="dreamer">Dreamer</h2>

<p>The dreamer can access the part of the mind which is always a sleep and always connected to the dream world. The dream world is sometimes called <em>The Edge</em>. Dreamers are often confused with mentalists because they can do almost all of the same things a mentalist can.</p>

<p>Dreamers must buy a magic and a lore skill. Dreamers can buy the following spells just like mages, 5 XP is one spell point:</p>

<h2 id="hunter">Hunter</h2>

<p><img src="http://amd-icbm.com/icbm/media/uploads/2011/02/hero-norn.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>

<p>A hunter is one of the easiest classes, at each level you can tame another creature. If the creature dies you can tame another one. This will take time to form a bond. Every creature has it’s own unique abilities. You have a mind link to these creatures but cannot have conversations with them. You can see what they see, you can feel what they feel but not every creature can, for example, listen in on a conversation.</p>

<p>You have spells with which you can buff the creatures, these spells work the same way as the mage spells:</p>

<table>

<h2 id="shaman">Shaman</h2>

<p>A Shaman gets a combination of the spells of a mage. The following spells will be automatically assigned to you when you level.</p>



<h2 id="skinwalker">Skinwalker</h2>

<p>You can shape-shift into creatures, taking their specific traits. You will maintain your own DMG and armor but are able to fly when you shift into a bird or breath underwater when you turn into a fish. You choose one creature and every 2 levels you gain another shape-shift form.</p>

<p>Skinwalkers can also adopt certain traits of the creatures into themselves so for example if they shapeshift into a dog they can shift the <em>smell</em> traint into themselves. Hawks have great sight, etc etc.</p>



<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>

<p>Now with a clear picture of all the small components of the game we can start a few combats and see how they go.</p>

<p>Combat is fairly straightforward and uses opposing rolls with a d20 dice. When it is a player’s turn to do something he tells the GM what he does, rolls a d20, adds it to his relevant skill and gives that result to the GM. If a saving throw is allowed the GM rolls a d20, adds it to the relevant skill of the opponent and if that total is lower than the total the attack gave the player can roll for DMG.</p>

<p>Rolling a 20 is a critical and rolling a 1 is fumble. With a critical you can do a few things, trigger the secondary effect of your weapon. Do max DMG, get your AP refunded or get a +5 to every skill against that opponent for 40 IP.</p>

<p>Imagine a player who plays a Dwarven Warrior lvl 1 named Vincent. He has a two-handed sword and a skill level of 12. Vincent encounters a bandit fighting with a sword and shield. This bandit has a skill level of 9. Vincent has Armor 10 (banded mail) and the bandit has Armor 7 (4 leather, 3 medium shield). Both Vincent and Sue (yes, the bandit’s name is Sue) have 14 AP and 14 HP.</p>

<h1 id="gear">Gear</h1>

<p>Weapons have a category and the specs of a weapon are based on this category. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GM notes: The idea of the gear is that it has ranks just like a character can have levels. Ideally a character should walk around in gear which is of the same rank. As a GM you can “play around” with these ranks and the gear. If you have a medieval setting you can have a max of rank 1, maybe rank 2 can be better material and rank three is great craftsmanship with excellent materials. I would advise against going higher in rank than rank 3 for simple settings. <br>
  Pure fantasy settings might increase the ranks of items as they see fit. Just keep in mind that ranks are there to be balanced and increasing the rank really changes the gameplay of the combats!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="melee-weapons">Melee Weapons</h2>

<p>Melee weapons are designed to have a certain DPI, DMG per Initiative. This is: <br>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-290">
	\frac{avg \; DMG}{IM}
</script></p>

<p>Every weapon has a secondary effect which you can use when you roll a critical.</p>

  <p>GM Notes: Weapons do not only grow in DMG as the ranks get higher. Gear in general also becomes more powerful. At rank one a weapon should 1 statistic point. <br>
  At rank 2 we should grant either 2 bonus to statistics or 1 rank of a spell/ability.  <br>
  At rank 3, 3 bonus to a statistic or 1 rank of a spell/ability <br>
  At rank 4, 4 bonus to a statistic and a rank of a spell/ability. The item can also grant a minor special. <br>

<h2 id="shields">Shields</h2>

<p>You can only use a shield if you have a one handed weapon and your PHY is equal or higher than the protective value of the shield. The PV of a shield and the armor is cumulative and so the total PV is the PHY you must have.</p>

<p>Just like weapons, the shields can increase with rank. </p>

<h2 id="armor">Armor</h2>

<p>You can only carry Armor if your PHY is equal or higher than the protective value of the armor.  The PV of a shield and the armor is cumulative and so the total PV is the PHY you must have.</p>

<p>Just like with weapons the armors can change with rank. Your PHY is still the max PV you can carry, but parts of the armor might be magical. I would advice something like:</p>
